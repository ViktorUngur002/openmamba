## Introduction :book:

Our work introduces OpenMamba, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation based on State-Space Models. Its usage of Mamba architecture yields better performance and uses less memory. The proposed method can be easily be integrated with [MAFT+](https://github.com/jiaosiyu1999/MAFT-Plus) model.

## Getting Started :gear:

+ [Installation](INSTALL.md).

+ [Preparing Datasets for OpenMamba](datasets/README.md).

+ [Training & Evaluation](TRAIN_EVAL_GUIDE.md).

## Model weights

We provide the pretrained weights of our model at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yan4vIiY9Uo-snMlBEwvaONIpLljbWF-/view?usp=sharing). The model was trained using a single NVIDIA 4070 Ti GPU.
